## ðŸ”§ Debugging

The game includes an optional debug mode to display FPS. Debug mode can be enabled by setting the 'debug' variable to true.

- [ ] Implement a debug console that can be toggle on and off to display values in real-time. (e.g. position, score, timers, etc)

- [ ] Use Love2D's `love.graphics` library to draw debug information directly onto the game screen. You can draw shapes, lines, and text to represent variable values, collision boundaries, or any other relevant information.

- [ ] Implement interactive debugging tools that allow you to inspect variables and their effects in real-time. This could include pausing the game to inspect variable values, stepping through code execution, and visualizing data structures.
